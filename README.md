## 📜 Background

This repository documents the findings, legal correspondence, and public data surrounding **RTI No. MORTH/R/E/25/02425**, filed with the **Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH)** in May 2025.

The RTI aimed to uncover:
- Mileage loss between E10 and E20 blended fuels

- Battery reuse/recycling audits and compliance
- Cost-to-consumer vs government subsidy in ethanol transition
- Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) of EV/ethanol projects
- eChallan enforcement on government vehicles
